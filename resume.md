### BUILDING SCALABLE & RELIABLE ML SYSTEMS
I work at the intersection of **ML Engineering, Data Engineering, and DevOps**, designing **scalable, production-ready ML platforms**. I focus on **clean architecture, fast iteration cycles, and long-term maintainability**, bringing **ML models and data pipelines from prototypes to production** while optimizing infrastructure for performance.

## EXPERIENCE
### Data & ML Platform Engineer
Apr 2021 - Present, Zürich, Switzerland (On-site)

- Developed a supply chain optimization service using **ML-based demand forecasting** and **linear optimization** to automate supply chain planning and daily inventory allocation. Reduced **manual planning from 3 days to 1**, distributing **12,000 fresh products daily to 1,000+ points of sale**.
- Migrated legacy data pipelines to a **modern cloud-based system**, optimizing **ML/data processing for 6M+
records/day** and reducing KPI computation time by **80%**.
- Built a **Kubernetes-native, distributed batch processing system**, replacing a monolith with a **scalable, modular
pipeline** that runs steps independently and scales dynamically.
- Applied **MLOps best practices** to **enable rapid, iterative model development and smooth deployment**, ensuring **versioning, monitoring, and scheduled retraining** via **Airflow**.
- **Collaborated closely** with **data scientists, backend engineers, and data engineers** to streamline **ML model deployment & data pipeline efficiency**.
- **Defined priorities and aligned technical work with business needs**, taking on **product ownership responsibilities**.

**Technologies used**: Python, Airflow, Snowflake, Kubernetes, SQL, Docker, DBT, Azure, MLflow, Linear Programming, pandas, numpy, CI/CD.

### Virtual Reality Software Engineer
Sep 2020 - Dec 2020, Zürich, Switzerland (On-site)

- Built a **real-time VR simulation** to analyze how speech patterns change in different environments.
- Developed virtual environments (e.g., lecture hall, baby room) and a **control interface** for researchers to select phrases and display them within the simulation.

**Technologies used**: Python, Unity, VR APIs.

### Student Teaching Assistant
Sep 2018 - Dec 2020, Zürich, Switzerland (On-site)

- Assisted in teaching **Visual Computing**, mentoring students & grading assignments. Topics included **computer graphics** and an introduction to **computer vision**.

**Technologies used**: Python, OpenGL, NumPy, WebGL.

### Android Developer
Jun 2016 - Sep 2019, Geneva, Switzerland (On-site)

- Developed a **nightlife discovery app** that allowed users to find events, follow artists, and book tables.
- Implemented the **Android application end-to-end**, integrating real-time event notifications and ticketing features.

**Technologies used**: Java, Android SDK, Firebase, REST API
